# Multilingual Hypergraph Transformer

## Overview
The Multilingual Hypergraph Transformer is an advanced deep learning model designed to classify text data across multiple languages. By utilizing embedding layers, contextual RNNs, graph convolution networks (GCNs), and attention mechanisms, this model effectively understands and categorizes complex language patterns.

## Features
- Multilingual Support: Seamlessly processes text in various languages.
- Contextual RNN: Captures sequential dependencies in textual data.
- Graph-based Representation: Models relationships between tokens using GCNs.
- Attention Mechanism: Incorporates multi-faceted attention for focused information retrieval.
- Customizable Configuration: Easily adjustable hyperparameters for diverse datasets and tasks.

## Installation
To install the Multilingual Hypergraph Transformer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
   git clone https://github.com/REtatrd-1337/MHT.git
   cd MHT
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the main application:

```Bash
   python main.py
```

   This will start the application in an isolated environment with all dependencies pre-installed.

## Usage
### Initialization
To initialize the model, create an instance of MultilingualHypergraphTransformer:

```Python
model = MultilingualHypergraphTransformer()
```

### Tokenization
The model includes a built-in tokenizer for pre-processing input text:

```Python
tokenized_texts = model.tokenize(["Hello, world!", "Bonjour le monde!"])
```

### Training
You can train the model using the train_model method:

Python


model.train_model(training_data, target_data)

### Prediction
Make predictions using the predict method:

```Python
predictions = model.predict(tokenized_texts)
```

## Configuration
Model parameters can be adjusted in the config.yaml file:

```
embedding_size: 768
contextual_hidden_size: 768
hidden_size: 256
num_classes: 3
batch_size: 32
epochs: 10
```
